**Draught in China**

China's loess plateau (between Hohhot and Lanzhou): lots of earth layers suitable to research historic climate conditions. Sciensts found 129000 years
the climate warmed resulting in disappearance of the winter monsoon, leading to extreme draught. This might happen again, with consequences for agriculture and the drinking water supply for Beijing and Tianjin. The government is building huge water transfer infrastructure, but it is not clear if this will solve the problem.

**Acidic oceans**

Oceans are acidifying because of CO2. Usually oceans are basic, allowing shellfish to form shells etc. Ocean chemistry is quite delicate, but a change in pH from 8.2 to 7.7 is expected, rendering large parts of the ocean effectively toxic large portions of calcareous marine life. One important affected species is plankton- the entire global ecosystem depends on plankton, and if CO2 emissions continue, a lot of plankton will die, with grave consequences for marine life in general. Shellfish will also be affected directly. Also, phytoplankton is now taking up C02, so less phytoplankton is a positive feedback loop.

**Increased warmth in Europe**

As summers in Europe get hotter, every year more people die of hypothermia in summer. Just in Paris, 10k people died- throughout Europe, 22-35k. Agriculture suffered losses of 12 billion in crop destruction, while forest fires caused 1.5 billion in damage. It seems like all summers will be of similar or greater intensity if current global warming trends continue.

**Mediterranean sunburn**

Throughout southern Europe and North-Africa, temperature and draught will increase, leading to more forest fires and changing living conditions to cope with the intense heat.

**The coral and the ice cap**

Research suggests that just a small increase in temperature might actually completely melt the ice on Greenland, leading to multiple meters increase in sea-levels (instead of the few centimeters the IPCC expects), affecting millions of people living in coastal cities. This might already happen at an increase of 1.2 degrees. The good news is that this will probably happen quite slowly.

**Last stand of the polar bear**

The retreat of sea ice lays bare new sources of fossil fuels in, for example, Canada and the North Pole. Polar bears and walrusses likely won't survive, and many other species native to the Arctic will likely die out. Indigenous populations of the Arctic will not die out, but their way of life and source of food is under threat.

**Indian summer**

Two degrees of warming would threaten wheat production in Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh- a net loss of 8 percent. More monsoons means more flooding in India and Bangladesh in particular, while melting glaciers in de Himalayas will cause more destructive mudslides.

**Peru's melting point**

Lima gets its water from glaciers in the Andes, which will have mostly disappeared at two degrees. Other cities around the Andes have similar problems. As usual, the poorest will be hit first.

**Sun and snow in California**

In winter, river basins in Washington, Oregon and California fill up with snow, providing the drinking water the US population uses the rest of the year. As the winters become less cold, there is less snow and thus less drinking water. States are already fighting over the water that is left.

**Feeding the eight billion**

Global warming will improve agricultural conditions in some places, like the north of the US, the UK and Russia. The poorest countries in Africa and South America will, unfortunately, suffer the greatest losses due to draught. The south of the US will also suffer negative effects. Also, fish like salmon are likely to be driven to extinction.

**Silent summer**

While the majority of humans are likely to survive two degrees, many enblematic plants and animals will likely die out. This is in part due to the speed of the change- if the climate would be changing slower than it is changing now, species could have time to adapt. Some models suggest that a third of currently existing species might die. Besides this just sucking in general, it might also kill more humans if we fail to replace threatened ecosystem services.

### 3 degrees

**What every Botswanan wants**

Botswana is already an extremely arid country. The warming of the Indian ocean causes rain to fall before reaching the land- a process that is already responsible for draughts in other parts of East Africa, and that will get worse. This will lead to famine and might even render large parts or Sub-Saharan Africa unfit for human life due to expansion of the Kalahari desert and dunification of existing Savannahs.

**The Christ Child returns**

El Nino has been disrupting weather patterns for a long time, ranging from flooding of deserts in Peru, to draughts in Indonesia and India, to possibly even the sinking of the Titanic by making icebergs drift further south than usual. The warming of the Pacific ocean could increase the intensity of El Nino events or even make the conditions that occur during El Nino events permanent. This could include famines killing millions on the Indian subcontintent, as well as drying and killing most of the biodiversity in the Amazonian rainforest.

**The death of the Amazon**

The Amazonian rainforest could die, reversing the carbon cycle- instead of taking op carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide now stored in the wood and soil of the forest would get released, leading to a massive acceleration of global warming. Under the surface of the forest lies a lot of peat, that can catch fire when the forest on top of it burns and smolder on for decades: another positive feedback loop. In the end, the majority of the rainforest would become a desert.

**Australia's Ash Wednesday**

Australia has been the target of fires for a long time. A six-fold increase in days where the temperature reaches above 40 degrees, further decreases in rainfall, and the disappearance of fresh water are scheduled for a three-degree increase. Large parts of Australia would become unlivable.

**Houston, we have a (hurricane) problem**

America's east coast is getting increasingly hit with devastating hurricanes.
Millions living in tropical storm basins, like the Philippines, Taiwan, the US and China, will see an steady increase in frequency and intensity of typhoons and hurricanes.

**Dawn over a new arctic**

The arctic area, Greenland, and parts of Iceland and Norway that are now covered by snow and ice, will melt. While the climate will become more less harsh, it is unlikely to open up large areas of new farming area, since the arctic soil is rocky and acidic.

**Mysteries of the Maya's**

The Maya civilization collapsed largely due to draughts between 810 and 910 AD, some lasting multiple years, destroying agriculture. Draughts are definitely on the agenda in a three degree world, Central America being a vulnerable area that will likely be hit first.

**Mumbai's monsoon**

The crops of 60 per cent of the world's population depend on a single recurrent weather feature: the Asian summer monsoon. Millions go hungry in years when the monsoon fails to bring its promised rains, and millions more lose their homes to flooding when the monsoon brings more of a deluge than the land can hold. The intensity of the monsoons is likely to increase, but the monsoons will also be less predictable and more variable. This makes agriculture more difficult.

**Where the Indus once ran**

The Indus is already more arid than the other rivers than spring from the Himalayas, like the Yangtze and the Mekong. Melting glaciers in the Himalayas will dry it out even more. Pakistani agriculture, relying heavily on the Indus, will suffer and cause food shortages and economic crises in Pakistan.

**The last drops of the Colorado**

The Colorado river is not a natural river anymore, but more of a giant plumbing system controlled by dams. Long story short: less water, no snow, hotter summers and winters, fires.

**Sinking the Big Apple**

Sea levels near New York City have already risen by 25cm in the last century, and will continue to rise in the next. The city is already at risk of flooding during heavy storms, and the higher base level in addition to stronger storms will likely result in many deaths. Coastal protections are possible but will cost billions.

**Storms gather in Europe**

The 1953 storm that killed many in London and even more in the Netherlands was then classified as a 'once in a 120 year' event. In a three degree world, it would be a seven to eight year event. In addition, because of rising sealevels, a large part of the Netherlands might reclaimed by the sea.

**Africa's fever**

As rainfall increases in East Africa, more puddles will be left behind by storms. These puddles are breeding grounds for diseases like Malaria.

**Paradise lost**

Tepuis are rock platforms in Venezuela filled with unique species that occur nowhere else on the world. The species living on these Tepuis will die out in a three degree world. The same goes for many plants in Europe, coral reefs and Siberian tigers, among others. For 10 to 50% of all species on earth, the climate they are evolved to live in, will change. Some estimated say that by 2050, more than half of all species on earth will be 'living dead', meaning their extinction is inevitable.

**Growing food in the greenhouse**

Over 30 degrees, rice, wheat and maize become 10% less productive for every degree higher. At 40 degrees, yields are zero. This will lead to a structural famine, accompanied by conflict, refugees and societal collapse.

### 4 degrees

**Death on the Nile**

In a four degree world, 1.5 million inhabitants of Alexandria will be displaced by rising sea levels. The damage done by the sea swallowing the city is estimated to be 35 billion dollars. Millions more in the Nile delta will be evicted, not to mention 1/3 of Bangladesh, cities like Boston, Shanghai and Mumbai. Island nations like Fiji or Barbados are most at risk. If the ice sheets of Antarctica melt slowly, there might be enough time for mitigation, but if there is a tipping point, there won't be time for that.

**The heart of Antarctica**

The last time the world was on average four degrees hotter, there was no ice at either poles. This might happen again.

**Capitalism with Chinese characteristics**

One fifth of species in China are now threatened with extinction, and three quarters of lakes in China are polluted. With the current increase in living standards and population growth, Chinese will need 100 million barrels of oil per day, while current global production is only 80 million. Once more than three degrees is reached, China's agricultural production will collapse. Similar things will happen to many other 'breadbowls' around the world. While some areas in Siberia might open up temperature wise, they lack the necessary rainfall to be utilised effectively for agriculture to compensate for the collapse of other global argicultural areas.

**The sands of Europe**

The deserts of North Africa might spread upwards as far as France or southern Ukraine. Snowfall will disappear almost entirely (only some parts in Scandinavia will be saved).

**Into thin air**
